# Five Lectures on FinTech 

This collection of five lectures covers a small selection of topics in FinTech. I will be using slides, readings, referrring to various URLs (web sources) and programming in Python. I will use mostly open source tools, but some in class demos will also use proprietary products. The five lectures are described below. 

## Lecture 1: Modern Payment Systems

This lecture covers: (i) An introduction to Python in Jupyter notebooks; (ii) Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies; (iii) Payment systems. We will begin with an introduction to Python for Financial Modeling, so that you are able to come up to speed with the main language being used for many applications in FinTech. In order to get a job in the FinTech space, Python is the lingua franca.
