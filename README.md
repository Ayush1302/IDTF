# Five Lectures on FinTech 

This collection of five lectures covers a small selection of topics in FinTech. I will be using slides, readings, referrring to various URLs (web sources) and programming in Python. I will use mostly open source tools, but some in class demos will also use proprietary products. I will host all the materials in *github* at the following repository, from which you may download the needed files (or clone and pull) the repository if you are familiar with using github. See: http://github.com/srdas/IDTF.

The five lectures are described below. The numbering begins from Lecture 6, as there are going to be five lectures preceding this one. 

## Lecture 6: Modern Payment Systems

This lecture covers: (i) An introduction to Python in Jupyter notebooks; (ii) Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies; (iii) Payment systems. We will begin with an introduction to Python for Financial Modeling, so that you are able to come up to speed with the main language being used for many applications in FinTech. In order to get a job in the FinTech space, Python is the lingua franca. In preparation for this class, please undertake the following. 

#### Python 

- Install anaconda, which includes Python and many useful libraries. Download the single install file from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Once you have installed it, use the launcher to start up the Jupyter notebook. I will assume you know how to initiate and use Jupyter notebooks. (By the way, Jupyter is an acronym that the dev team chose as it includes three popular programming languages, Julia, Python, and R.) 
- Visit the Jupyter project web site (http://jupyter.org/) and check out the documentation there. See: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html. 
- Try out the starting notebooks from here: https://try.jupyter.org/
- Especially, if you have not use Python before, then please go through the "Welcome to Python" notebook. Open it in your browser and then execute each cell block, you need to use the command Shoft+Enter (as stated there). Look at the output and then compare it with the code. 
- A good book to get started with Python is "Python for Data Analysis", which I prefer to call **p4da** - it an excellent introduction, and is especially apt because the author WesMcKinney built the Pandas package (Chapter 5) for use at one of the top hedge funds (a good example of a firm that uses FinTech). An older edition is available online: http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~embat/Python%20for%20Data%20Analysis.pdf. I strongly recommend skimming through and learning the first four chapters, and then spending time on chapter 5, giving it a much more careful read. In addition, the best way to learn is to try out lines of code in a Jupyter notebook alongside, as you read. 
- I will be using the following notebook in class, which will be provided in advance: **GetStarted_Python_in_Finance.ipynb**. You will find this in the course folder. 

#### Blockchains and Payment Systems

- Next, we will move on to a technical exposition of blockchains and related cryptocurrencies. You will have already obtained some familiarity with this topic from earlier lectures. 
- The slides for this lectures are in: **6_BlockChains_and_Cryptocurrencies**. Within these slides there will also be links to more readings. This is to incentivize you to go through the slides in advance and follow the links and do some more reading to facilitate discussion in class. This is expected of you. 
- Coverage will be on both the business and technical aspects of: distributed ledgers; blockchain; cryptocurrency; bitcoin; transaction flow; hash functions; digital signatures; double spending; proof of work; mining; security; malicious attack; Ethereum; smart contracts; merkle tree; gas; difficulty; Ethereum virtual machine; DAO; initial coin offerings; hyperledger; futures; blockchain infrastructure; payment systems; crypto portfolios (see **CryptoPortfolio.ipynb**).
