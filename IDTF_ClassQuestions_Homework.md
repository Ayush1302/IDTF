## Lecture 6: Python and Blockchain

### Questions to prepare before class:
1. What are the financial business opportunities for blockchain technology? Come up with a few examples and explain why you think they are plausible. What are the main value drivers?
2. What are the main hurdles for large-scale implementation of blockchain technology?
3. Come prepared to propose one possible application of blockchains that would be especially useful for India.
4. What do you think will happen when all BTC have been issued?
5. Why might BTC be less useful? What are the drawbacks?
6. Compare Proof of Work (PoW) versus Proof of Stake (PoS).
7. How is Ethereum better or worse than Bitcoin?
8. Is portfolio theory applicable to cryptocurrencies?
9. Why is blockchain technology likely to be disruptive?

### Homework:

1. Using Python, download a daily history of your top 5 favorite cryptocurrencies. Plot them. You can use an API or download the data into a spreadsheet and read it from there. 
2. Convert the prices into returns. Keep the most recent period in which all these currencies were trading. What is this period?
3. Prepare the correlation matrix of returns of these assets. 
4. Prepare the covariance matrix of returns of these assets.
5. Suppose you bought and held each asset from the beginning to the end of the period. What is the mean and standard deviation of daily returns? What is the annualized Sharpe ratio? Comment. 
6. Now form an equally-weighted portfolio of all these assets. What is the mean and standard deviation of the daily returns of this portfolio? Annualized Sharpe ratio? Is this better than holding individual currencies?
7. Now form a mean-variance portfolio using the Markowitz approach. Pick any mean daily return you are comfortable with. Compute the mean, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio from daily returns for this portfolio, and comment? 
8. Download the stock index (S&P 500, ticker GSPC) series for the same period and compute returns. Regress the return of your portfolios in Qs 6 & 7 above and report the Beta of each portfolio. Comment.
